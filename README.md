# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

### A binary tree is a data structure made up of nodes. Each node contains:
* A value (or data).
* A pointer (or reference) to two child nodes, which are the left child and the right child.

### A binary tree has the following properties:

* Root: The top node of the tree.
* Leaf nodes: Nodes with no children.
*  Subtree: A tree formed by any node and its descendants.

### Basic Operations on Binary Trees
* Insert: Add a node to the tree.
* Search: Find if a value exists in the tree.
* Traversal: Visit all nodes in the tree in a specific order (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
* Delete: Remove a node from the tree.
